## 1. The First Law, applied to Z

**Confidence is not the conserved quantity. Uncertainty is.**

Let `u = (256 − confidence) / 256` — normalized ignorance.
Z has `u = 1`. Certain has `u = 0`.

Excel — the corroboration formula — is *identically* multiplicative
uncertainty combination:

```
u_result = u_a × u_b
```

Verified exactly across the full grid: **1089 / 1089**.

That is the standard rule for combining independent evidence: the chance
both witnesses are wrong is the product of each being wrong. It was
derived here from first principles and landed on the correct formula.

### Three consequences that were never designed in

**Excel creates nothing.** Two witnesses agreeing does not manufacture
confidence. It multiplies two ignorances into a smaller one. The
confidence was already distributed across the witnesses; corroboration
only revealed it. Conservation holds.

**Z-contagion is not a rule — it is arithmetic.** `u = 1`, and
`1 × x = 1` for every x. Z is the absorbing element under multiplication.
Anything mixed with total ignorance yields total ignorance. This was
written into the language as a design decision; it turns out to be a
theorem.

**Certain is unreachable by combination.** `u = 0` requires some
`u_i = 0` exactly. A product of non-zero terms is never zero. No stack of
imperfect witnesses, at any strength or count, reaches certainty.

### The bug this found

The integer scale used to round the last fraction away:

```
excel(250, 250) → 256     manufactured Certain from evidence
excel(255, 255) → 256
```

True values were 255.78 and 255.94 — never 256. The language was
inferring Certain from accumulated evidence, contradicting its own rule
that Certain is earned at runtime and never guessed.

Fixed in C, Python and Ruby. Combination now caps at 255. Only two
already-verified inputs (both exactly 256) return 256.

```
excel(250, 250) → 255
excel(256, 256) → 256
```

### Where thermodynamics stops being a good analogy

The Third Law says absolute zero is unreachable in finite steps. Ever's Z
is reachable instantly, by contagion. The analogy holds for the First Law
(conservation) and breaks for the Third. Worth saying plainly rather than
stretching the metaphor.

## 2. The corpus weighed against φ

**φ does not govern the archive. 1 of 6 ratios land near 1.618, which is
what chance would give.**

| ratio | value | vs φ | |
|---|---|---|---|
| patterns : errors | 1.263 | 0.781 | |
| mean confidence : execute floor | 1.039 | 0.642 | |
| Certain : execute floor | 2.000 | 1.236 | |
| π-warn : π-squared | 3.240 | 2.002 | |
| execute floor : π-warn | 1.580 | 0.977 | **at φ** |
| intake : π-warn | 1.481 | 0.916 | |

φ earns its place as the **output equalizer**, where it is applied
deliberately to flag outliers against a set mean. It is not a law the
corpus obeys on its own.

The three constants do three different jobs, and only two are structural:

- **256** is load-bearing. 4⁴, the states of a byte, the whole scale.
- **π** sets widths. ⌊256/π⌋ = 81, ⌊256/π²⌋ = 25, ⌊π⌋ = 3.
- **φ** equalizes output. Applied, not obeyed.

Claiming φ governs the system would be decoration, and a technical
investor would find that in ten minutes.

## 3. Defect profile

Every finding across every layer classifies into the five binding
defects. Nothing fell outside the taxonomy.

| defect | count | share |
|---|---|---|
| unbounded | 16 | 84.2% |
| orphaned | 2 | 10.5% |
| misbound | 1 | 5.3% |

**Unbounded dominates at 84%.** Extent-not-delimited — missing
terminators, unclosed structures, unbounded writes. That is the single
highest-value defect class to target, and it is the one most amenable to
static detection.

Three of five classes appeared. `unbound` and `overbound` did not surface
in this corpus, which is a statement about the corpus, not the taxonomy.

## 4. Witnesses required to converge

From equal independent evidence, to reach a target:

| each | →128 | →200 | →240 | →255 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 60 | 3 | 6 | 11 | 24 |
| 100 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 13 |
| 128 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 9 |
| 150 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
| 180 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| 200 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 5 |
| 240 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 |

256 appears nowhere. That column does not exist, and its absence is the
formal reason Certain must come from outside the corpus.

## 5. Executed verification

| layer | assertions |
|---|---|
| 0 · C — the atom | 88 |
| 1 · C++ — the phase engine | 50 |
| 2 · Python — the interpreter | 81 |
| 4 · SQL — the archive | 56 |
| **total** | **275** |

Layer 3 (Ruby) is written and inspected clean at 228/256 by Ever's own
Ruby checker, but has not been executed — no Ruby toolchain in the build
container. It runs on macOS.

Layers 5 (Java) and 6 (HTML) are not yet ported to the v2 atom.

## 6. What is safe to claim

**Supported:**
- Excel is exactly multiplicative uncertainty combination (1089/1089)
- Z-contagion is a consequence of that algebra, not an imposed rule
- Certain is formally unreachable by combination at any strength
- Every finding classifies into five binding defects
- 275 assertions execute and pass across four layers
- Anchored threads cross five languages with zero loss; unanchored drift
  is measurable and the database refuses to record an anchored loss

**Not supported:**
- φ governing the corpus
- Self-correction. The system teaches and verifies; it does not yet
  rewrite broken source.
