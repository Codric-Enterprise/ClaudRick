    Energy is neither created nor destroyed, only transformed. The

        u_result = u_a * u_b

    Three consequences, none of which were designed in. They fall out.

    1. Excel creates nothing. Two witnesses agreeing does not manufacture
       confidence; it multiplies two ignorances into a smaller one. The
       confidence was always there, distributed across the witnesses. The
       system only revealed it.

    2. Z is the absorbing element. u = 1, and 1 * x = 1 for every x. That
       is WHY Z is contagious. It was never a rule imposed on the system;
       it is what maximum uncertainty does under multiplication.

    3. Certain is unreachable by combination alone. u = 0 requires some
       u_i = 0 exactly. No finite stack of imperfect witnesses reaches it.
       Certain has to come from outside the corpus, which is precisely why
       the language earns it at runtime and never at parse time.
