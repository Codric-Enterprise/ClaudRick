# EZR — Operational Semantics

**Version 0.3 · Codric Enterprise · Ricky (Dreid) · 2026**

Every rule below is implemented in `2-interpreter-python/abstract.py` and
exercised by `abstract_test.py`. Where the spec and the implementation
disagree, the spec is wrong and gets fixed — not the other way round.

---

## 0. What EZR is

A language in which every binding carries **what it holds** and **how
much that binding is trusted**, and in which nothing executes below a
stated floor.

Formally: a pure, strictly-evaluated, lexically-scoped first-order
functional language over a trust-annotated value domain, with a
possibilistic chain rule and a probabilistic corroboration rule.

EZR is **not** Turing-complete by default. Unbounded recursion is a
privilege earned by proof, not a default granted on request. That is a
design commitment, not a limitation to be fixed later.

---

## 1. Semantic domain

A **thread** is the only kind of value.

```
θ  ::=  ⟨ v , σ , c , [lo,hi] , ℓ , α , δ , g , ρ ⟩

  v   the thing held          (int | real | text | bool | closure | ⊥)
  σ   state                    Z | Confident | Certain | Equivalence
                               | Expression | Emulating | Evolved
                               | Anchored | Absent | EError
  c   confidence               0 … 256
  lo,hi  bounds                for Equivalence; otherwise lo = hi = c
  ℓ   source language
  α   anchor id                0 = unanchored
  δ   defect                   none | unbound | misbound | unbounded
                               | overbound | orphaned
  g   generation               Evolve cycles survived
  ρ   reason                   why it is untrusted, preserved always
```

**Uncertainty** is the derived quantity that the laws are stated over:

```
u(θ)  =  (256 − c(θ)) / 256          u ∈ [0,1]

u = 1  ⟺  Z          u = 0  ⟺  Certain
```

### 1.1 Scale constants

| Constant | Value | Derivation |
|---|---|---|
| `CERTAIN` | 256 | 4⁴, the states of a byte |
| `EXECUTE_FLOOR` | 128 | 256 / 2 |
| `PI_WARN` | 81 | ⌊256/π⌋ |
| `PI_ENUMERATE` | 25 | ⌊256/π²⌋ |
| `DEPTH_CEILING` | 3 | ⌊π⌋ |
| `ASCEND_POINTS` | 3 | ⌊π⌋ |
| `INTAKE` | 120 | what **external** data is worth before evidence |

### 1.2 Two entry points, not one

EZR distinguishes two questions that an earlier draft conflated:

| Question | Answer | Entry confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Do I know what the program **says**? | always yes | `Certain` (256) |
| Do I know this reflects **reality**? | often no | `INTAKE` (120) |

A **program constant** — a literal written in EZR source — carries no
uncertainty about its value. The author wrote `1`; it is `1`. It enters
at `Certain`.

**External data** — anything lifted through `Any` from another language,
a parser, a scanner, an API — enters at `INTAKE`, below the execute
floor.

This distinction is load-bearing. Treating source literals as external
input floored every computation in the language at 120: a verified
function given a certain argument returned the correct answer and could
not certify it, forever. Uncertainty in EZR belongs to **data from
outside** and to **whether functions are correct** — never to what the
program says about itself.

---

## 2. The two composition laws

EZR has **two** operators, drawn from **two different formalisms**, used
for **two different questions**. This is deliberate and must be stated
plainly, because silently mixing them would be an error.

### 2.1 Chain — `min`

> *What is the floor?*

```
                θ_f , θ_1 … θ_n
    ────────────────────────────────────────         [CHAIN]
    c( f(θ_1…θ_n) ) = min( c_f , c_1 , … , c_n )
```

The **possibilistic** rule (Zadeh). A result is no more trusted than its
weakest participant. This is a **bound**, not a probability, and must
never be reported as one.

Chosen over the probabilistic rule (`c_f × c_x / 256`) because chains
compose without collapsing: a ten-step computation over trusted inputs
stays usable. The cost is that `min` does not track accumulated
independent error. EZR accepts that cost and states it.

### 2.2 Corroborate — multiplicative uncertainty

> *What does the combined evidence support?*

```
              θ_a , θ_b  independent, v_a = v_b
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────    [EXCEL]
              u( a ⊕ b )  =  u(a) × u(b)
```

Equivalently `c = a + b − ⌊ab/256⌋`. Verified identical across the full
grid: **1089 / 1089**.

This is the standard rule for combining independent evidence — the
probability that both witnesses are wrong is the product of each being
wrong.

**Corroboration requires agreement on the value.** Two threads at the
same confidence holding *different* values do not corroborate; they
collide, and Expel applies.

### 2.3 Three theorems

**T1 — Z is absorbing.** `u(Z) = 1`, and `1 × x = 1`. Z-contagion is not
a rule imposed on the language; it is what maximum uncertainty does under
multiplication.

**T2 — Corroboration creates nothing.** Two witnesses agreeing does not
manufacture confidence. It multiplies two ignorances into a smaller one.
The confidence was already distributed across the witnesses.

**T3 — Certain is unreachable by combination.** `u = 0` requires some
`u_i = 0` exactly. A product of non-zero terms is never zero. Therefore
`EXCEL` caps at 255, and `Certain` must enter from outside the corpus —
at runtime, never at parse time.

---

## 3. Evaluation

Strict, left-to-right, pure. No mutation anywhere: the archive's audit
trail depends on every thread being *derived*, never overwritten.

### 3.1 Literals

```
    ─────────────────────────────           [LIT]
    ⟨ n ⟩ ⇓ ⟨ n, Confident, 120 ⟩
```

### 3.2 Variables

```
    x ↦ θ ∈ Γ                    x ∉ Γ
    ─────────────  [VAR]     ─────────────────────────────  [VAR-Z]
    Γ ⊢ x ⇓ θ[α:=0]          Γ ⊢ x ⇓ Z(unbound, "never bound")
```

**A reference never inherits an anchor.** The anchor belongs to the
binding that earned it. `θ[α:=0]` is load-bearing: without it, anchors
would propagate by mere mention and continuity would be meaningless.

### 3.3 Arithmetic

```
    Γ ⊢ e₁ ⇓ θ₁    Γ ⊢ e₂ ⇓ θ₂    σ₁ ≠ Z    σ₂ ≠ Z    τ₁ ≈ τ₂
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  [OP]
    Γ ⊢ e₁ ⊕ e₂ ⇓ ⟨ v₁ ⊕ v₂ , Confident , min(c₁,c₂) ⟩

    σᵢ = Z                                  τ₁ ≉ τ₂
    ─────────────────────────  [OP-Z]    ─────────────────────  [OP-τ]
    Γ ⊢ e₁ ⊕ e₂ ⇓ Z(δᵢ, ρᵢ)              ⇓ Z(misbound)
```

Division by zero yields `Z(misbound, "division by zero")`. There are no
exceptions in EZR; **evaluation is total**. Every expression returns a
well-formed thread.

---

## 4. Functions

### 4.1 Definition

A function is a **thread whose value is a closure**.

```
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────  [DEF]
    Γ ⊢ def f(x̄) = e  ⇓  ⟨ ⟨f,x̄,e,Γ⟩ , Confident , 120 ⟩
```

It begins at `INTAKE`, below the execute floor, for the same reason a
literal does. A definition is a claim, not a verification.

### 4.2 Example — how a function earns confidence

Each passing Example is an independent witness at intake strength, so
Examples **corroborate under [EXCEL]**. One Example no more verifies a
function than one observation lets a binding Ascend.

```
    u_f = ((256 − 120)/256) ^ p          p = passing, t = total
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────  [EXAMPLE]
    c_f = ⌊ 256 · (1 − u_f) · (p/t) ⌋      capped at 255
```

Observed:

| Examples passed | Confidence | |
|---|---|---|
| 1 / 1 | 120 | below floor — one case proves nothing |
| 2 / 2 | 183 | clears |
| 3 / 3 | 217 | |
| 4 / 4 | 235 | |
| 2 / 3 | 122 | a failure costs |

**A depth-exceeded Example counts as a failure.** Otherwise the ceiling
would be free.

### 4.3 Application

```
    Γ ⊢ f ⇓ θ_f    v_f = ⟨f,x̄,e,Γ_f⟩    |ā| = |x̄|
    ∀i. σ(θ_i) ≠ Z        depth ⊑ limit(θ_f)
    Γ_f[x̄ ↦ ā] ⊢ e ⇓ θ_r
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  [APP]
    Γ ⊢ f(ā) ⇓ ⟨ v_r , min(c_f, c̄, c_r) ⟩
```

Failure cases, all total:

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| `θ_f` is Z | `Z` — propagated |
| `v_f` not a closure | `Z(misbound, "not a function")` |
| arity mismatch | `Z(misbound)` |
| any argument Z | `Z` naming that argument |
| depth over limit | `DepthExceeded` — a checked halt, not a hang |

### 4.4 Anchoring a function

```
    cleared(θ_f)    ¬recursive(v_f)
    ────────────────────────────────────  [ANCHOR-FN]
    anchor θ_f ⇓ θ_f[σ:=Anchored, α:=fresh]

    cleared(θ_f)    recursive(v_f)    measure(v_f) = m
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  [ANCHOR-REC]
    anchor θ_f ⇓ θ_f[σ:=Anchored, α:=fresh, depth:=∞]

    recursive(v_f)    measure(v_f) = ⊥
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  [ANCHOR-⊥]
    anchor θ_f ⇓ Z(unbounded, "confidence proves trust, not termination")
```

**[ANCHOR-⊥] is the rule that keeps the language honest.** A function can
sit at 240/256 and still loop forever. Confidence is evidence about
*correctness*, and correctness is not termination. Anchoring a recursive
function without a decreasing measure would turn "unbounded depth" into
"hangs."

### 4.5 The measure

`measure(f) = m` when some parameter `m` **strictly decreases in every
self-call**. The check is deliberately conservative and syntactic:
recognised forms are `m − k` for `k > 0` and `m / k` for `k > 1`.

When decrease cannot be proven, the answer is ⊥ and the ceiling stays at
`⌊π⌋ = 3`. **Refusing to guess is the point.** A wrong termination proof
is worse than no proof.

### 4.6 Depth

```
    limit(θ_f) =  ∞    if α(θ_f) ≠ 0  ∧  measure(v_f) ≠ ⊥
                  3    otherwise
```

**Depth is earned.** Verification purchases the right to go deep.
Observed: `fact` blocked at n=8 unanchored; after 3 Examples and an
anchor, `fact(100)` computes at depth 99.

---

## 5. Conditionals

### 5.1 Known condition — lazy

```
    Γ ⊢ c ⇓ θ_c    σ_c ≠ Z    v_c = true    Γ ⊢ e₁ ⇓ θ₁
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────  [IF-T]
    Γ ⊢ if c then e₁ else e₂ ⇓ ⟨ v₁ , min(c_c, c₁) ⟩
```

`e₂` is **not evaluated**. This is not an optimisation — it is required.
Evaluating both arms eagerly makes every recursive function
non-terminating, because the recursive arm runs even when the base case
was selected. This was found by construction, not by argument.

### 5.2 Unknown condition — eager, and it spans

```
    Γ ⊢ c ⇓ Z    Γ ⊢ e₁ ⇓ θ₁    Γ ⊢ e₂ ⇓ θ₂    v₁,v₂ numeric
    hi − lo ≤ 81
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────  [IF-Z]
    ⇓ ⟨ Equivalence, [min(v₁,v₂), max(v₁,v₂)], min(c₁,c₂) ⟩
```

A Z condition does **not** collapse the expression. "It is one of these
two" is real information, and discarding it would be a lie in the other
direction.

π then judges the width with **no special-casing**:

| Width | Verdict |
|---|---|
| ≤ 25 | acceptable |
| 26 … 81 | must enumerate |
| > 81 | collapses to `Z(unbounded)` |

Supporting cases:

```
    v₁ = v₂                          v₁,v₂ not numeric,  v₁ ≠ v₂
    ─────────────────────  [IF-AGREE]   ──────────────────────  [IF-⊥]
    ⇓ ⟨v₁, min(c₁,c₂)⟩                  ⇓ Z(unbounded, "not spannable")
```

**[IF-AGREE] is worth noting:** when both arms give the same answer, the
unknown condition is *moot*. The result is known despite the ignorance.

**Evaluation strategy is therefore hybrid:** lazy under a known
condition, eager under an unknown one. The expense lives in the unknown
case, which is the correct place for it.

## 6. Guarantees

| # | Property | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **G1** | Evaluation is total — no exceptions, no undefined behavior | proven by construction |
| **G2** | Z is absorbing (T1) | algebraic |
| **G3** | Confidence never rises except via `Ascend` or `Excel` | enforced |
| **G4** | `Ascend` requires 3 aligned points | enforced |
| **G5** | `Certain` unreachable by combination (T3) | algebraic |
| **G6** | Anchored threads cross languages losslessly | tested, 5 hops |
| **G7** | Unanchored crossings lose exactly 1 per hop | tested |
| **G8** | Recursion terminates or halts at a checked ceiling | enforced |
| **G9** | No mutation | by construction |
| **G10** | Every finding classifies into 5 binding defects | 19/19 observed |
| **G11** | State and confidence never disagree — `Certain` is exactly 256 | enforced |

**Not guaranteed, and stated so:**

- **Termination in general.** Only for anchored functions with a proven
  measure. Unanchored recursion halts at the ceiling rather than
  diverging, which is a weaker but honest promise.
- **Type soundness.** Checking is dynamic. There is no static type
  system and no progress/preservation proof.
- **Confidence calibration.** Nothing asserts that a thread at 200/256
  is right 78% of the time. Confidence is an internal ordering, not a
  measured frequency. **This is the largest open claim in the language.**

## 7. Not yet specified

Named honestly, because scope depends on it.

| Missing | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Records | only lists so far; `E_TYPE_LIST` is implemented, records are not |
| Pattern matching | only `if/then/else` |
| Static type system | dynamic tag checks only |
| Module system | one flat global namespace |
| Transpiler back-ends | anchored bodies do not yet emit Rust/Go/TS |
| Soundness proof | no progress/preservation |

Three rows left this table, and they were removed because
`2-interpreter-python/audit.py` proved they were false rather than
because anybody remembered:

| Was listed missing | Actually |
|---|---|
| Composite data (records, lists) | lists parse, evaluate, and take their confidence from the chain rule over their elements. Records remain missing, so the row narrowed rather than went |
| Higher-order functions | functions have always been able to be arguments: `twice(inc, 5)` is 7 and `twice(dbl, 5)` is 20. This row was never true |
| Formal grammar (EBNF) | `7-forge/GRAMMAR.ebnf` is emitted from the chart parser's own rule table, so it cannot drift from the code |

That last pair is the reason the auditor exists. A specification that
overstates is dangerous because somebody relies on it; one that
understates is cheaper but still false, and it hides finished work from
whoever is deciding what to build next. Higher-order functions were
listed as missing for as long as this document has existed and worked
the whole time.

**Transpilation is the largest gap.** The decision is that an anchored
function's *body* travels into the target language, with its Examples as
the verification contract: the emitted Rust must satisfy the same
Examples to inherit the anchor. Nothing of this is built.

## 8. Worked example

```ezr
def fact(n) = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * fact(n - 1)
```

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `[DEF]` | thread at 120/256, recursive, measure `n` found |
| `fact(3)` | 6 — depth 3, within ⌊π⌋ |
| `fact(8)` | **blocked** — DepthExceeded at ceiling 3 |
| Examples `(1,1) (2,2) (3,6)` | 217/256 by `[EXAMPLE]` |
| `[ANCHOR-REC]` | Anchored, depth := ∞ on measure `n` |
| `fact(100)` | computes, depth 99 |

Every value returns at **217/256** — the chain rule flooring on `fact`
itself, which is exactly right: *a result is only as trustworthy as the
function that produced it.* The literals `1` in the base case are program
constants at `Certain` and do not drag the floor down.

An earlier draft floored this at 120 by treating source literals as
external input. That made every computation in the language permanently
unexecutable. The fix was one localised change at the entry points, not
a rebuild; four tests failed and all four had been asserting the defect.
